# Migration Notes

## What Was Consolidated

This document explains how the original 4-folder structure was consolidated into a clean monorepo.

### Original Structure
```
NEXUS-START-UP 31.07.25/
├── Nexus 1month/                    # Main Next.js frontend
├── nexus-catalog-frontend-main/     # Secondary Next.js frontend (nearly identical)
├── nexus-merchant-dev/              # Django backend (development)
└── nexus-merchant-master/           # Django backend (production, identical to dev)
```

### New Structure
```
nexus-platform/
├── frontend/                        # Consolidated Next.js application
├── backend/                         # Consolidated Django API
├── docs/                           # Documentation
├── setup.bat                       # Automated setup script
└── README.md                       # Main documentation
```

## Changes Made

### Frontend Consolidation
- **Source**: `Nexus 1month/` (chosen as primary)
- **Reason**: Had complete dependencies including `@2gis/mapgl` for maps
- **Discarded**: `nexus-catalog-frontend-main/` (missing map dependency, otherwise identical)

### Backend Consolidation  
- **Source**: `nexus-merchant-dev/` (chosen as primary)
- **Reason**: Development version with complete setup instructions
- **Discarded**: `nexus-merchant-master/` (identical to dev version)

### Preserved Information
- All original setup instructions saved in `docs/ORIGINAL_SETUP_NOTES.md`
- Complete dependency lists maintained
- All source code preserved
- Docker configurations maintained

## Benefits of Consolidation

1. **Eliminated Confusion**: No more wondering which folder to use
2. **Reduced Duplication**: Removed nearly identical codebases
3. **Better Organization**: Clear frontend/backend separation
4. **Easier Maintenance**: Single source of truth for each component
5. **Improved Documentation**: Comprehensive setup instructions
6. **Automated Setup**: `setup.bat` for quick environment setup

## Verification

All functionality has been preserved:
- Frontend: Complete Next.js app with all dependencies
- Backend: Complete Django API with all apps (core, orders, stores, users)
- Documentation: All original setup instructions preserved
- Configuration: Docker, environment files, and build scripts maintained
